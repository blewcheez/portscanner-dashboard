<h1 align="center">Port Scanner Dashboard üñ•Ô∏è </h1>

<h4 align="center"> Why is this helpful? </h4>
<p align="center"> A port scanner is an essential tool for system administrators and cybersecurity professionals to assess network security, manage IT infrastructure, and troubleshoot connectivity problems. By proactively identifying open and vulnerable ports, organizations can harden their defenses against attackers who use port scans to find weak points.   </p>

<br> </br> 

<h2 align="center"> üì¶ Technologies & Libraries used and why </h2>

- Visual Studio Code (VSCode) - The editor where all the code was written, tested, and managed.
- Python - Simple and quick for building tools without a steep learning curve.
- Flask - Lightweight Python web framework. Turns the collected data into a simple web dashboard I can view in my browser.
- Git Bash - So I can run my Python app functions and push my project to GitHub more easily.
  <br> </br>

  <h4 align="center"> Walking Through My App </h4>
  
<p align="center"> First, I open git bash, then navigate to the folder that my portscanner-dashboard app is in. Then I proceed to run the command "python app.py" </p>

<br> </br>


<p align="center"> Once the data is collected, I then run the Python "app.py", which then displays the portscanner-dashboard on the IP at (http://127.0.0.1:5000/). </p>
